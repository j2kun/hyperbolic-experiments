def compute_fundamental_triangle(tessellation_configuration):
    """Compute the vertices of the hyperbolic triangle with the following
    properties:

     - Vertex A lies at the origin.
     - Vertex C lies on the x-axis.
     - Vertex B is chosen so that angle CAB is pi / p, and (hyperbolic) angle
       ABC is pi / q.

    Derivation:

    The desired point is B = (b_x, b_y). This point is on the line
    L: y = tan(pi / p) x and on an unknown circle C perpendicular to the unit
    circle with center G = (g_x, 0).

    If A = (0, 0) and D = (d_x, 0) is the intersection of the line [AG] with C,
    then we need (hyperbolic) angle ABD to be pi / q. This is the same as
    requiring that the tangent line to C at B forms an angle of pi / q with the
    line between A and (cos(pi / q), sin(pi / q)), which has slope
    tan(pi / p + pi / q).

    The slope of a tangent line to circle C at point B is given by

        y'(B) = -(b_x - g_x) / b_y

    Setting y'(B) = tan(pi / p + pi / q) and writing b_y in terms of b_x gives

        tan(pi / p + pi / q) tan(pi / p) = (g_x - b_x) / b_x

    Or, letting Z = tan(pi / p + pi / q) tan(pi / p),

        b_x(Z + 1) = g_x.

    Next, we use the fact that C and the unit circle are orthogonal to get a
    relationship between their radii (pythagorean theorem):

        1^2 + r^2 = g_x^2, where r^2 = (b_x - g_x)^2 + tan(pi / p)^2 b_x^2

    substituting in g = b_x (Z + 1) and solving for b_x,

        b_x = sqrt(1 / (1 + 2Z - (tan(pi / p))^2))

    We can then solve for b_y, g, and d_x trivially.
